# Void

Void is a minimal knowledge space focused on clarity and focus.  
It is intended to be a quiet place for thoughts, notes, and references—without noise or pressure.

## Intent

Void aims to:
- Stay minimal and calm
- Reduce cognitive load
- Avoid productivity gimmicks
- Let ideas exist without forcing structure

This project is exploratory and evolving.

- Simple note creation and editing
- Clean, distraction-free interface
- Optional sign-in (e.g. Google) for future sync

- Lightweight organization (tags / links)

Nothing here should be assumed as implemented.

## Non-Goals

Void does not aim to be:
- A task or habit manager
- A social or collaborative platform
- A feature-heavy productivity system

The current focus is on defining the core idea before building features.
