# Void Space

Void Space is a minimal, offline-first knowledge space focused on clarity and focus. It is designed to be a quiet place for your thoughts, notes, and references—without noise, pressure, or productivity gimmicks.

## 🌟 Philosophy

Void aims to:

- **Stay minimal and calm**: Reduce cognitive load with a clean, distraction-free interface.
- **Avoid productivity gimmicks**: Let ideas exist without forcing structure.
- **Respect privacy**: Your data stays on your device using fast, local storage.

## ✨ Features

- **Semantic Search**: Find your thoughts naturally. Void Space uses local embeddings to power semantic search
- **Frictionless Capture**: Save links, text, and notes instantly from anywhere using the native Share Intent (Android) with a seamless experience.
- **Inline Editing**: Quickly edit titles, tags, and notes inline without breaking your flow.
- **Beautiful UX**: Smooth pull-to-refresh animations, staggered grid layouts, and a cohesive design language.
